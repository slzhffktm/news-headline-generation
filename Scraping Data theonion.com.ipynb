This is really a mess. I’m so sorry, everyone. Wish I could be there.” Carlson also confirmed that the weather had left his apartment’s electricity somewhat spotty, preventing the unrepentant phony from doing any work from home.'},\n",

She almost nailed it. And this is the woman who asked if the internet was as good as the online. It’s certainly the most precise she’s been in a long time.” At press time, Burkhart’s children decided to give it to her, claiming that she got close enough.'},\n",

Then we discovered a clip with some of the very same men sharing a spaghetti dinner in a luxurious prison cell, which was perhaps the best evidence to date that these were no isolated sequences, but components in what could quite possibly be a feature-length film.” Carnevale went on to say that despite the many clear connections among Goodfellas YouTube clips, no direct associations were as yet found between them and the Matrix recommendations in the sidebar.'},\n",

A staple at the Iowa State Fair and part of a tradition dating back to 1911, the 5-and-a-half-foot-tall, non-homogenized-milk-fat sculpture of a grazing bovine received 64 percent of the vote, easily defeating opponents Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Ron Paul. \"For one thing, I’m more familiar and comfortable with the butter cow,\" said Iowa voter Horace Wright, who cited the creamy sculpture’s even demeanor, its pro-agriculture agenda, and the fact that it’s not Mitt Romney as his primary reasons for voting for it. \"And second, looking at the rest of the field, I think at this point the butter cow is the Republican Party’s best shot at beating Obama in November.\" Exit polls revealed many caucus attendees considered Jon Huntsman, but ultimately concluded they didn’t want to waste their votes.'},\n",

This is why it’s crucial that you do your research before you drive off a steep rock face.” At press time, Condon also warned that most car dealers often refuse to take back any vehicle immediately after it explodes at a cliff’s base.'},\n",

Also, we strongly recommend stretching all six legs before starting and urge insects not to overexert themselves by darting straight up a wall if they haven’t done it in a while.” Leon reminded insects that the best long-term health results could be achieved by combining 30 minutes of skittering each day with a high-protein diet of skin flakes.'},\n",

We certainly condemn his horrific actions, however, we’re not going to sit here and act like we wouldn’t have done the same thing if we were in his shoes.” The judge then reportedly issued a mandatory life sentence without parole even though he acknowledged the defendant’s family probably “had it coming.”'},\n",

Certainly, a severed head taketh some upkeep, and oft needeth replacing, due to the effects of weather and worms; but Heaven has seen to provide us with slanderers aplenty and no end of pikes. And, lo! What a conversation piece! Should a visiting duke notice yon head, you merely have to ask him ‘Oh! Did you know Lord so-and-so?’ and you are off, don’t you see.” The peasantry, when asked, were almost unanimous in their agreement that the current head-on-a-pike was a great improvement over the last one, that of known blasphemer Lady Suzanne Colgrave.

Sure, once in a while an applicant can really shine at the end of an interview and overcome an unimpressive start, but in general, people need to be on their game from minute one if they want to prove to prospective employers that they’re someone who deserves to live.” Researchers added that despite the study’s intimidating findings, job applicants can improve their odds of surviving the first interview by preparing responses for a range of potential questions, dressing professionally, and always carrying a concealed weapon in an ankle holster.'},\n",

Conditions were really bad—there was a lot of drifting snow, and wind speeds fluctuated between 30 and 50 miles per hour all day, more than enough to pick the cows up, slice them from the tips of their noses to the roots of their tails, and arrange their organs to spell out the word ‘soon.’ Evidently, the low dew point also caused them to glow a pale, eerie green color. Anyway, this is really an open-and-shut case of death by exposure, and we have extensive documents signed by ranking officers of the Strategic Air Command testifying to that effect.” At press time, Washington law enforcement urged citizens living in the area to stay indoors, focus on keeping warm, and check their family members for a 3-inch scar below their right clavicle.'},\n",

If they’re not dragging their feet getting our new legislative demands in front of Congress, they’re rushing out some executive order before we’ve even finalized it. We don’t know what’s going on half the time, so how on earth are we supposed to get anything accomplished?” An exasperated Shoigu went on to say that the administration was in such disarray, rolling back sanctions might take a year longer than planned, and abandoning NATO might actually be out of the question.'},\n",

And this doesn’t even factor in the massive economic cost to Cheddar Bay, whose restaurants had been responsibly trawling for biscuits for generations before Red Lobster’s massive fleet arrived.” Gross went on to say that a moratorium was the only solution until the biscuit populations were fully replenished, urging Red Lobster to temporarily double up on far more plentiful hush puppies.'},\n",

Even if the campaigns talk about us in a manipulative or patronizing way—that’d be okay, so long as there’s an actual acknowledgment of the millions upon millions of Americans in my situation.

Our officers merely responded in the fashion they were taught, trained, and socialized to do, namely pinning the black man down and shooting him several times.” Landry added that new community-building programs would hopefully bridge the gap between law enforcement and the misguided crowds that still believe they can uneventfully go out at night while black.'},\n",

People nearly always found ways to overcome their opposing tastes, often through skillful negotiations that resulted in ordering sausage on one half of the pie and just plain cheese on the other.” In addition, the study found that humans are never more divided than when attempting to determine how much they should chip in for the order, considering that some of them only ate two slices and didn’t even have any cheesy bread.'},\n",

And if they aren’t patched up by adding some solid dialogue or an additional explanatory scene, then the plotholes will continue to grow and we’ll need to send in a specialized crew to tear up the script and do a complete overhaul on the underlying storyline. Not only are plotholes annoying for moviegoers, but if you run into enough of them, they can totally destroy your suspension of disbelief.” Emphasizing that regular maintenance was critical, Barnett said that he expected viewing conditions to improve significantly before the summer blockbuster season, when the number of plotholes is expected to quadruple.'},\n",

While this is somewhat heartening, our research found that it has been decades since an individual was observed acting in a charitable way by breaking a $10 bill for a stranger.” The report also found that the most prevalent act of human hostility remained asking to bum a smoke, but then turning down a menthol cigarette.'},\n",

Then we simply commit an entire generation of young Americans to dying in numbers so great that they will permanently change the geography of the Korean peninsula.

And faced with the unsavory prospect of women receiving fair pay or having their sexual assault claims taken seriously, Americans went to the polls today and made their voices heard loud and clear.

After backing slowly away from his desk, the president informed his top aides that, if he can get back from the inauguration quickly enough, he also plans to place a bag of canine excrement near the Rose Garden door and set it aflame. \"The commander in chief has successfully executed this mission with precision and decisiveness,\" said White House press secretary Dana Perino, speaking to reporters with large black circles around her eyes. \"Unfortunately, he is not able to return to his desk for the remainder of his term due to all the thumb tacks, but he will continue to lead the nation from the Roosevelt Room.\" Taking his place in a long history of executive office shenanigans that began with President Martin Van Buren\\'s famous sneezing-in-Jackson\\'s-coffee prank of 1837, Bush carefully drafted his personal letter to the next president on White House stationery, filled the envelope with glitter, and then used rubber cement to secure the letter to the bottom of his desk\\'s right-hand drawer. In what may turn out to be his greatest presidential prank, Bush also has spent the previous eight years damaging the American economy beyond repair and bogging the country down in an unwinnable war with a sovereign Middle Eastern nation.'},\n",

I hate the work, and the hours are fucking awful. And I’ll bet they’re bringing back my old dickhead boss who’s never satisfied no matter how much weapons-grade U-235 we crank out.

Fenton, adding that residents should designate an alternate exit from their home in case the front door is obstructed by the person who calls out to them by their former name and says, “What, you think I just forgot?” “And since you might have just minutes or even seconds to safely vacate your property, have a pre-written note on hand that you can quickly drop on the kitchen table, telling your family that you have to leave but that you love them very much. The faster you can leave your home, the more likely you are to survive, even if you now realize that your days of running will never truly be behind you.” Fenton went on to say that every American should also have a first aid kit in their go-bag in case a bullet catches them just as they turn the corner.'},\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON—Providing a lengthy, comprehensive explanation of the factors influencing his decision to declare a national emergency that would send military funding and personnel to the nation’s southern border, President Donald Trump offered a clear, historical precedent Friday for deploying the U.S. military with no provocation. “What the critics who have questioned the validity of my actions seem to be ignoring is that there are abundant examples of instances in the history of this country wherein a president invoked his executive powers to station troops, not to defend ourselves against an aggressor, but simply to further our nation’s economic and political interests,” said Trump at press conference, frequently referencing a chart he had created tracking U.S. military deployments through history both within the country and abroad, specifically citing President Andrew Jackson overriding the Indian Removal Act and the Supreme Court ruling in Worcester v. Georgia in the forced expulsion by the military of the Cherokee from their lands, the secret use of military advisors and support by Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1953 Iranian coup d’état, and the recent precedent of extraneous invasions of other countries without the approval of Congress in violation of the War Powers Resolution by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. “Listen, folks, I would invite you to consult the history books, where you will see that posting troops at the border in the defense of an exaggerated claim that such security is needed to protect Americans is broadly in line with similar invasions, troop deployments, and other military activities throughout American history perpetuated to annex land, attack countries with governments not subservient to our country, or to further the interests of our client states. What I’m doing is entirely in keeping with the way that the U.S. government usually acts—time and time again, our leaders have ignored the basic conditions that would prompt acceptable military action, so why should this national emergency be treated differently? To this end, I would quote the words of Noam Chomsky, who said that ‘If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.’ I would additionally invite my critics to consult scholarly texts on William McKinley’s role in the annexation of the Philippines, the rationale used by Lyndon Johnson for ramping up troops in Vietnam, and Richard Nixon’s economic warfare in the 1973 Chilean coup, as I have, if they are interested in understanding why any accusation that I, as president, do not have historical precedent to back me up on this border security effort is without merit.” Trump also added that such precedents, as well as U.S. military activity in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba, would give him more than sufficient historical justification for any similarly unprovoked, unilateral military action his administration may decide to undertake in Venezuela.'},\n",

I did one of these a year ago, so it should be the same dog and pony show where I roll out whatever evidence the department handed over and let the jury ruminate on all the gaping holes in the case I was unable to fully address. Then they’ll say there’s no probable cause and I get to go home.” Despite looking forward to the case, Gorman told reporters that he expects to be completely swamped with work prosecuting protesters arrested in the days following the acquittal.'},\n",

We’d invariably end up with several missing parts, and we could only speculate about what might have filled them. But now, we can safely say that these empty spaces were most likely filled with other bits of rock. It looks nothing like we could possibly imagine.” Powell added that further research was necessary to determine if a geological link existed between rocks, pebbles, and boulders.'},\n",

For example, we’ve had our eye on a Scandinavian country for some time, while China’s been pushing hard to get us involved with a Latin American nation. But we both agree that if we’re honest about our economic wants and needs, we may find a country that will not only revitalize our trade relationship, but bring us closer together than ever before.” Froman added that the U.S. would be careful not to make the same mistake it did with Venezuela a few years back, when a jealous tiff over petroleum exports led to a series of economically painful sanctions that has left the two no longer on speaking terms.'},\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON—Following a decade-long study of economic trends and employment rates, a report issued Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics determined that excitedly circling a newspaper listing with a red marker remains the single most effective way to find a job. “Our research confirms that laying out the morning paper on the kitchen table, slowly panning down a column in the classifieds section, and then enthusiastically drawing a bold red circle around a posting in the center of the page is still the best way to secure employment,” said the report’s lead author, Rebecca Carney, adding that unemployed individuals were further able to increase their likelihood of obtaining work by tapping the listing with their finger while quietly saying “That’s the one.” “We also found that using the same pen to double-underline the job’s salary range raises one’s chances of being hired by an additional 50 percent.” Carney went on to add that individuals were able to effectively guarantee a job offer by calling the business immediately on their landline phone, grabbing their hat and jacket off a coat rack, and quickly heading straight down to the company’s offices with the newspaper tucked under their arm.'},\n",

Again, this is purely conjecture at this point.” Albertson said he would just have to wait for the movie to come out to see if the human and robotic elements of the character’s identity come into conflict with one another, especially during the film’s quieter, more emotional scenes.'},\n",

By this point, they should be experimenting with things like group sex with identical quadruplets, but it’s pretty obvious that the writers are just on autopilot now.” Despite their disappointment with the episode’s lackluster incest, fans almost unanimously agreed that the show’s latest season had staked out bold new territory in terms of narrative implausibility.'},\n",

Major roadways were reportedly closed to traffic in anticipation of the event, and a jubilant crowd poured into the streets, swarming Discovery Green in hopes of witnessing the historic moment in person. Sources noted a mood of giddy anticipation spreading through the park as the tightly packed throngs waited expectantly for Cruz to take the stage and announce he was bringing his presidential bid to an end. “I’ve been dreaming about this moment since the first time I heard Ted Cruz speak, and I just had to be here to see it happen,” said Kevin Chavis, a voter who drove nearly nine hours from Memphis, TN to hear the 45-year-old senator publicly state that while he was proud of all he had accomplished, he did not see a way forward for his campaign at this time. “I’m going to remember this day for the rest of my life!” “We were all so excited watching the numbers come in and realizing this was finally going to happen,” Chavis added. “Words can’t express how happy I am right now.” Witnesses told reporters the park was teeming with people who shouted out in celebration, exchanged high-fives, hugged complete strangers, danced, and spontaneously broke out into choruses of “God Bless America.” According to those present, several vendors were selling commemorative merchandise, a brass band played, and a sense of euphoria took hold as revelers waited for the moment when a chastened, sober-faced Cruz would step to the podium and concede the failure of his candidacy. One audience member remarked that she had taken her children out of school for the day so they could attend the speech, saying the experience would be one her boys would always be able to look back on with fondness and pride.  “My kids just had to be here—I mean, this is one of the most important moments in American history,” said Martha Dorsey, who hoisted her 6-year-old son up onto her shoulders so he would be able to see the former White House hopeful’s face without a trace of its usual self-assured grin. “This is something they’re going to tell their kids about one day. They’ll say, ‘I was there the day Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign ended. I saw him up there holding back tears!’ How special is that?” Thousands of cameras reportedly flashed as Cruz appeared and walked across the stage, his gaze directed downward. Sources said that upon reaching the podium, the senator was forced to wait nearly 10 minutes for the cheering to die down before he could start speaking.

Reports confirmed that large screens erected throughout the park allowed even those hundreds of yards away to watch the man shift uncomfortably and choke up as he thanked his campaign team for its hard work. When Cruz stated that he would be returning home immediately to spend time with his family, tens of thousands of people were seen breaking into smiles and throwing their arms around one another, unable to contain their joy. “After Iowa, I really never thought this would happen,” said Houston resident Leslie Kemp, who wiped away a tear as she looked up at the slump-shouldered, visibly crestfallen figure on the stage. “But everyone came together, and we made it happen. It’s easy to be cynical about politics, about the state of our democracy. But seeing Ted Cruz up there announcing that he’s bowing out of the race—it made me proud of my country.” “I have real hope for the future now,” Kemp added. “We are finally headed in the right direction.”'},\n",

Sources confirmed that once stimulated, a flood of neurotransmitting chemicals burst across trillions of synapses within her gray matter in a matter of nanoseconds, igniting a fluid and breathtaking mosaic of electrical activity across her cerebral cortex that enabled her to visualize the swept-back hair, dark eyes, and thick brow of the star best known for his portrayal of Christopher Moltisanti on the HBO series The Sopranos. The staggeringly vast fusillade of neurological impulses is said to have not only allowed McClintock to picture Imperioli’s individual facial features, but to comprehend the whole of those discrete parts as well, and—by virtue of the unfathomably complex web of axons and dendrites working in concert on a scale 1,000 times more powerful than today’s fastest supercomputer—to also recall that the Moltisanti character had once been in an amusing scene in which he urinated on the side of Paulie Walnuts’ van. At press time, sources indicated the approximately 100 billion neurons composing McClintock’s brain—the miraculous biological end product of eons upon eons of evolution—had erroneously identified the image in her mind as the face of John Turturro.'},\n",

Far too many Americans are oblivious to food’s nutritional benefits and, frankly, its great taste. The eating of food is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but unfortunately, many people don’t realize they have a hankering for sustenance until it’s too late. Similar initiatives have worked wonders in Scandinavian countries, and with any luck, U.S. citizens will be digesting food in no time.” Gottlieb further speculated that the program, if launched earlier, could have prevented the American Southwest from starving to death last February.'},\n",

While few of these people have experience shuttling data between two points at the speed of light, most have reported a willingness to learn a new skill and be buried three feet below ground in order to improve their employment prospects.” Mueller added that infrastructure employment appeared poised for continued growth, noting that California’s proposed high-speed train system alone could create as many as 200,000 railroad-track jobs.'},\n",

Those authors really opened up a whole new world to me, which ultimately inspired me to devote my whole life to the craft of prose. Mrs. Merriman was the catalyst for that; I’ll never forget her.” At press time, sources confirmed Sheard would likely soon return to the classroom as a high school teacher himself to inspire a love of writing in students just as Merriman did for him.'},\n",

And not only will these LED lights reduce the nation’s carbon footprint, but they will also save a considerable amount on monthly electricity bills.

       "  'body': 'WOODBOURNE, NY—Reportedly left dumbfounded by the news that recent parolee Terry Raney had been reincarcerated on charges of assault and battery, officials at Woodbourne Correctional Facility struggled Tuesday to make sense of how the prisoner had not been rehabilitated by 15 years of constant threats, physical abuse, and periodic isolation. “It just doesn’t seem possible that an inmate could live for a decade and a half in a completely dehumanizing environment in which violent felons were constantly on the verge of attacking or even killing him and not emerge an emotionally stable, productive member of society,” said chief warden Albert Gunderson, who noted that, as hard as it was to believe, Raney’s recidivism proved that his criminal impulses had not in fact been corrected by the sense of grave distrust he felt toward every other person in the facility, including both fellow inmates and prison authorities, every day since 1999. “We surrounded him with a combustible mix of rival gangs and made sure that he was consumed by a round-the-clock sense of terror that the slightest misstep on his part could result in a sharpened piece of scrap metal being shoved into his neck, and yet he still leaves this facility with the same criminal thoughts and violent mindset as before? I’m truly at a loss for how this could have happened.” Gunderson then noted his additional confusion at how the man’s criminal record and the social stigma of his prison sentence had somehow failed to land him a steady job immediately upon his release.'},\n",

Because, let’s be clear: Your mother’s heart will literally stop,” said Iowa Economic Development Authority director Debi Durham in a press conference advising Iowan millennials to find a nice apartment that’s close enough to home that they can visit on weekends. “You would kill your mother by moving out of state. Sure, big cities might have a bunch of fancy shops and restaurants, jobs there would pay you enough to frequent those places, and you probably wouldn’t have to live within a mile of a million-gallon open-air hog-feces retaining pool. But nothing compares to a home-cooked meal prepared by your proud, healthy, living mother.” Durham brought her speech to a close by alluding to forthcoming retention campaigns with slogans such as “Don’t Be Ungrateful” and “Your Mother Is Very Frail.”'},\n",

At this point, it’s a cultural imperative for everyone to pitch in by performing small but measurable tasks—such as replacing 150 hectares of industrial buildings with hardwood forests in every U.S. city—if we want to stall the meteoric rise in global temperatures for a few more years.” Moffat added that reversing climate change can be as simple as removing every single car from the road or perfecting cold fusion.'},\n",

Our needs for oyster crackers are being met and then some. Could things take a downturn in the future vis-a-vis oyster crackers? Certainly. But there is nothing to suggest that we are moving in that direction as of now.” Researchers acknowledged, however, that despite current positive trends, the country likely would never match up to the golden era of oyster crackers of the late 1840s.'},\n",

We also advise against repeatedly slamming your computer onto the surface of your desk while letting out an intense scream of rage, or even just angrily folding your laptop’s monitor all the way back until it snaps off in your hands, despite the sensation of pure ecstasy either action would immediately induce.” The report went on to encourage the nation’s workers to instead take a walk around the block to relieve their stress, even though it would feel like a huge fucking letdown.'},\n",

Just to be safe, I should always keep a healthy gap between myself and the person seated next to me from now on. But, honestly, it’s unacceptable for even my own hand to rest on my knee—it’s the first wicked step on the path to a life of whoremongering.” At press time, Pence had instructed aides to bind his wrists behind his back at the beginning of every meeting.'},\n",

And I’m not always able to respond, which makes me feel guilty. I wish things were as easy for me as they are for [Maryland Sen. Ben] Cardin. He just drives up and hangs out with his voters pretty much anytime he wants.” Nelson later admitted that because he barely saw his constituency anymore, he had fooled around with lobbying firms on several occasions.'},\n",

She may be sending a message that, if we don’t comport ourselves correctly, we too will be dragged around the ocean for a couple weeks, just like her presumably smartassed calf. It’s absolutely incredible to behold.” Moments after Reyes’ statement, the orca breached the surface of the ocean behind Reyes and dragged her screaming and bleeding beneath the waves in response to the researcher’s remarks.'},\n",
